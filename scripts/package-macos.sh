# The bundle is built with NON_PORTABLE=ON so the runtime resolves saves,
# BattleShip.cfg.json, and the user's extracted BattleShip.o2r out of the
# OS app-data dir (~/Library/Application Support/BattleShip/) instead of cwd.
#
# Notes:
# - The .app does NOT include BattleShip.o2r — that's ROM-derived and gets
#   extracted on first launch via the ImGui wizard.
# - Code signing / notarization is not handled here; expect Gatekeeper to
#   warn on first launch. A future pass should sign with `codesign --deep`
#   and notarize via `notarytool`.

# ── 4a. Bundle Homebrew dylib dependencies (fixes #43) ──
# CMake links BattleShip / torch against Homebrew dylibs (SDL2, GLEW,
# libzip, tinyxml2, spdlog, fmt, …) using their absolute install paths
# (`/opt/homebrew/opt/<pkg>/lib/lib*.dylib`). On a developer machine the
# .app launches fine because every load command resolves verbatim. On
# any user's Mac without Homebrew at the same prefix and exact package
# versions, dyld bails before main() with `Library not loaded:
# /opt/homebrew/*/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib`. This is the macOS analogue of
# bundling SDL2.dll on Windows / `.so` deps via linuxdeploy on Linux —
# the package script must walk the binaries' transitive Homebrew deps,
# stage them into Contents/Frameworks/, rewrite each dylib's id to
# `@rpath/lib*.dylib`, retarget the binaries' references via
# `install_name_tool`, and add an `LC_RPATH` of `@executable_path/../Frameworks`.
#
# `dylibbundler` (Homebrew package) automates all of that. `-of` =
# overwrite-files (idempotent re-runs), `-b` = bundle transitive deps,
# `-x` = files to fix (repeatable for torch alongside BattleShip),
# `-d` = destination directory, `-p` = install_name prefix, `-cd` =
# create destination, `-ns` = skip dylibbundler's own adhoc codesign
# pass since the bundle-level `codesign --deep --force` below resigns
# everything in one shot.
#
# `-p @executable_path/../Frameworks/` makes the rewritten install_names
# fully self-resolving (dyld substitutes `@executable_path` with the
# directory of the loading executable — Contents/MacOS — so the path
# lands at Contents/Frameworks/lib*.dylib).  Setting `-p @rpath/` would
# require an LC_RPATH on the binary, and dylibbundler's existing-rpath
# rewrite stomps on that path with literal `@rpath/`, producing a
# recursive load command that dyld can't resolve.  Using the absolute
# `@executable_path` form sidesteps that.

# name, alias resolution back to the writable scratch image, .DS_Store
# write timing, and quarantine xattr stripping. Reinventing these
# workarounds isn't worth the maintenance.
