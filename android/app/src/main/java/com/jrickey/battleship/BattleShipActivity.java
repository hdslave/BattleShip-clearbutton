/**
 * BattleShipActivity — entry point for the SSB64 PC port on Android.
 *
 * Subclasses SDLActivity (vendored at android/app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app/
 * from SDL release-2.32.10). SDLActivity:
 *   1. Calls getLibraries() to know which .so files to System.loadLibrary
 *      (in order). The last one is treated as "the main library" and SDL
 *      dlopens it + dlsym's the entry function.
 *   2. Looks up getMainSharedObject() — defaults to libmain.so in our
 *      nativeLibraryDir, which is exactly what we ship.
 *   3. Looks up getMainFunction() — defaults to "SDL_main", which our
 *      port.cpp now exports thanks to SDL_main.h's `#define main SDL_main`
 *      on Android.
 *   4. Invokes nativeRunMain(library, function, argv) on a dedicated thread.
 *
 * That's it. All the GLES surface, audio, controller, IME, and lifecycle
 * plumbing is handled by SDLActivity itself.
